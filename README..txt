I first set the array of objects to be and empty array.

Then I iterated through each object in the original list and added them to a new
list, which is then added to the finalArray.

The code will basically iterate through the objectArray and push each element 
into an array.

The finalArray will be a new array with all the elements from the firts array.


I would appreciate enormously if you could provide some feedback on the task. 
What could've done better, was I heading on the right direction? 
This is the solution I came up with I'm sure it could have been done better. 
I know is not 100% what the task asks. Hence why it would be great if you could
give me your opinion as I really want to improve my skills and understanding.
